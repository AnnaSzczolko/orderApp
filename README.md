## About the Project

This project is a fullstack web application that allows users to browse meals, add them to a cart, and submit orders which are stored on a backend server.

The application demonstrates how a modern frontend built with **React and Redux** communicates with a **Node.js and Express API** to persist data and manage application state.

The project showcases my ability to design and implement a **complete fullstack application**, including frontend UI, global state management, backend API development, and communication between client and server.

The frontend and backend are deployed as separate services (Vercel and Render), reflecting a typical real-world deployment setup.


### Main goals of the project

* practice building a <b>fullstack application </b>
* implement <b> global state management using Redux</b>
* create a <b> REST API using Node.js and Express </b>
* connect a frontend application with a backend server
* handle <b> sending and storing orders </b>
* maintain a <b> clean project structure </b> and <b> responsive user interface </b>

This project was built independently as part of my developer portfolio.

## ▶️ How to run the project locally

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnnaSzczolko/orderApp.git
cd orderApp
```

### 2️⃣ Install backend dependencies 

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

Backend API runs separately and handles order storage.

### 3️⃣ Install frontend dependencies

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Open the application

Frontend runs on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

The frontend communicates with the backend API for fetching meals and submitting orders.
